# CS230 Operationg Platforms

# The client for this project was The Gaming Room. They had an existing game called Draw It or Lost It for a single platform and wanted to enhance its functionality and expand it to other platforms. The client's goal was to design software that would improve the game and make it available on multiple platforms. The emphasis was on creating a clear, concise, and focused document for the project.

# In developing this documentation, I did well in helping you maintain focus on the task at hand. The documentation aids in prioritizing important tasks and determining which ones require time and attention

# The design document helps in organizing thoughts, clarifying requirements, and defining the software architecture. It serves as a reference, keeping development focused and aligned with the initial plan. Though initially challenging, working through the document improves the ability to articulate recommendations and requirements effectively.

# I would revise the document to improve the clarity and organization of the requirements. Clear and specific details about the user's needs and expectations would be included to ensure the software solution meets their requirements. By addressing these aspects, the user's trust and satisfaction with the product can be enhanced.

# Understanding and incorporating the user's needs into the software design was crucial. By analyzing their requirements and preferences, I developed a design that prioritized user satisfaction and usability. Considering the user's needs is important because they are the ones who will use and determine the success of the product. By focusing on their requirements, we can create a user-centric design that enhances their experience and builds trust in the software.

# To approach software design, I focused on clear documentation and separating game functionality for easier updates and maintenance. In the future, I would use techniques such as requirement analysis, modular design, comprehensive documentation, design patterns, user-centered design, version control, and continuous testing and integration. These approaches ensure effective communication, scalability, usability, and software quality.
